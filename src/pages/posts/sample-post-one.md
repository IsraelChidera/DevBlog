Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning journey as I build a new website. If you're here, you probably want to learn how to create your own posts. Let's embark on this cosmic adventure together!

## What I've Accomplished 🌟

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts. Easy peasy, right? 🌱

2. **Making Pages**: Next, I learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder. It was like discovering hidden planets in a new galaxy! 🌌

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts, and I feel like a digital architect! 🛠️

## How to Create a New Post 📝

Creating a new post is as easy as pie. Follow these steps, and you'll have your first post up in no time!

1. **Create a New File**: In the `src/pages/posts` directory, create a new Markdown file with a `.md` extension. Let's call it `my-awesome-post.md`.

2. **Add Frontmatter**: At the top of your new file, add some frontmatter. This tells Astro important information about your post.

    ```markdown

    pubDate: 2024-06-15
    description: 'A short description of my awesome post'
    author: 'Your Name'

        alt: 'A descriptive alt text for your image'
    tags: ["tutorial", "astro", "blog"]
    ---
    ```

3. **Write Your Content**: Below the frontmatter, start writing your amazing content. Markdown makes it simple to add headers, lists, images, and more.

    ```markdown
    # Welcome to My Awesome Post!

    This is where the fun begins. 🚀

    2. **Using Markdown**: Tips and tricks for writing in Markdown.

4. **Save and Preview**: Save your file and run `npm run dev` to start the Astro development server. Navigate to your new post to see it live!
